Data Generation Documentation
Overview
This section documents the data generation phase of the project. The goal of this phase is to create large-scale, schema-aligned, synthetic data that can be loaded into SQL Server for practicing database design, constraints, ETL, and post-load data correction.
The generated data is intentionally imperfect in some areas. These imperfections are documented here and will be handled later using SQL Server transformations, updates, and constraints.

Tools & Libraries Used
Python
Used as the main language for data generation due to its flexibility and ecosystem.
Libraries
•	pandas: DataFrame creation, manipulation, splitting, and export to Excel
•	faker: Generating realistic but fake values (names, dates, locations)
•	random: Controlled randomness for quantities, statuses, and distributions
•	datetime: Time-based logic (order dates, status history, shipment dates)

Data Generation Methodology
General Approach
1.	Generate data table by table, respecting column data types and constraints
2.	Use sequential IDs in Python to simulate SQL Server IDENTITY behavior
3.	Export data to Excel files
4.	Insert data into SQL Server using Python (pyodbc)
5.	Perform data corrections and business-rule enforcement later in SQL Server
This mirrors a real-world scenario where raw data arrives imperfect and is fixed downstream.

Known Limitations & Intentional Data Issues
1. Referential Order Issues
Some tables may reference entities that are not yet created at the time of generation.
Examples: - Orders may reference customers that were not yet “registered” - Products may reference sellers before seller data is fully validated
Reason: - Python generation is schema-driven, not event-driven
Planned Fix: - Enforce referential integrity and correct invalid references in SQL Server using: - UPDATE statements - Validation queries - Constraint checks

2. Pricing & Financial Inconsistencies
Issues: - Order.TotalAmount initially set to 0 - OrderItem.UnitPrice may not match product price history - Discounts and payments are not fully aligned with order totals
Reason: - Focus of generation is volume and structure, not financial accuracy
Planned Fix: - Recalculate totals in SQL Server using: - Aggregations from OrderItem - Discounts and returns logic - Payment reconciliation queries
________________________________________
3. Order Status Timeline Is Not Fully Realistic
Issues: - Order statuses may span unrealistic timelines - Shipment types (Same Day, Standard, Express) are not fully respected
Example Problem: - Same-day shipment but statuses occur across multiple days
Planned Fix: - Update OrderStatusHistory in SQL Server so that: - Same-day shipments have all statuses on the same date - Express shipments respect max delivery windows - Status transitions follow logical order
________________________________________
4. Shipment Logic Simplifications
Issues: - All orders are marked as shipped - Delivery partners are randomly assigned - Shipment ratings are random
Reason: - Shipment generation focuses on schema population
Planned Fix: - Improve shipment realism using: - Status-based shipment generation - Delivery date rules per shipment type
________________________________________
5. Payment & Payment Status Simplifications
Issues: - Failed payments are generated with a fixed percentage - Retry logic is simplified
Business Rule Applied: - Failed and completed statuses cannot exist together for the same payment - Failed payments are retried and must eventually succeed
Planned Fix: - Use SQL Server to: - Validate payment lifecycle - Ensure financial consistency
________________________________________
Why These Limitations Are Acceptable
These issues are intentional and serve the learning objectives of the project: - Simulate messy real-world data - Practice SQL-based data correction - Apply constraints after ingestion - Perform analytical transformations
This reflects real production systems where: - Data is rarely perfect at ingestion time - Business rules are enforced downstream

Next Steps (Planned in SQL Server)
•	Fix referential inconsistencies
•	Recalculate financial metrics
•	Normalize timelines for orders and shipments
•	Enforce realistic business rules
•	Prepare cleaned data for data warehouse modeling

Note
This document covers data generation only. Other phases (OLTP modeling, DW modeling, ETL, BI dashboards) are documented separately.
